What was done: Refactor of the code, seperation of concern implemented, 

At the start of the lecture we learned that each component is a piece of code that is to be rendered on the web page, 
Now every component to be stored on a main App.jsx file is a hassle and become large and unmanageable, 
Hence now we implement of separation of concern and implement import and export keywords for reusing the component funcs, 

How naming of the component file is: {Convention for the File}
 1. Not Mandatory but preffere: Create a components sub-folder inside of the src folder, 
 2. The name of the file must be equivalent to the component func name, 
    Example if your component function name is: function Header(): File Name: Header.jsx
 3. Learn the practice of using export or export default, imp to know the diff in using 
    them, 

 Some Important Findings: 
    You noticed that I had splitted my Header.css file with styles related to my header Components, but what you need to understand is that even if I have created a Header.css in my Header.jsx file via import "./Header.css" you need to be aware that the style definition written on this 
    file for header element will be applied to all the header elements existing in the project. this
    is the default behavior of the React project, the codes will be separated for the separation of 
    concern only i.e for readability and maintainablity and debugging purposes nothing else.
